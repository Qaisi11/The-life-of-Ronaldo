		<h2>About Cristiano Ronaldo's Family:</h2>
		<p>Cristiano Ronaldo's family is an important part of his life, and he is a proud father to four children. Ronaldo keeps his family life quite private, but he has shared glimpses of his family on social media. He has a son, Cristiano Ronaldo Jr., who was born in 2010, and three other children: twins, Eva and Mateo, born via surrogate in 2017, and his daughter, Alana Martina, born in 2017 to his current partner, Georgina Rodriguez. Ronaldo is a dedicated father and often shares photos and videos of himself spending time with his children.</p>
